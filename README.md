# generator-simple-microservice [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]

> Generate a Node microservice with Docker, Express, Babel, and Node Inspector support

** NOTE: This is currently only proof of concept code under early development.**
It has been published to npm to share with the BayNode meetup group. If you
find this helpful, that's awesome.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-api using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-simple-microservice
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo simple-microservice
```
