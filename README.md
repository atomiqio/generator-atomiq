It has been published to npm to share with the BayNode meetup group. If you find this helpful, that's awesome.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-atomiq using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-atomiq
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo atomiq
```

## Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He&#39;s a person with feelings and opinions, but he&#39;s very easy to work with. If you think he&#39;s too opinionated, he can be easily convinced. Feel free to [learn more about him](http://yeoman.io/).
